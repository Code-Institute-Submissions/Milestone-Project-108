# <p align="center">Scotty’s Dog Training & Behaviour
<p align="center">This website is my first milestone project of the Code Institutes Full Stack Software Development Course. The goal of the project was to create a fictitious website for a professional Dog Trainer who specialises in dog training & behaviour modification.
The target audience for the website are dog owners who need support in dog training and behaviour modification. The services are aimed at both new and existing customers and dogs of all ages and breeds. 
The website is for educational purposes only</p>

## UX
 
### User Stories

- As a dog owner, I want to quickly see the website training methodology so that I know they align with my beliefs. 
- As a Dog Owner, I want to work with a qualified professional that uses positive reinforcement training methods only so that my family and I can learn the tools for continuous positive training throughout our dog’s life. 
- As a dog owner, I want to be able to quickly see the types of services on offer, so that I can determine if the trainer is a right fit for me. 
- As a new puppy owner, I want to be able to house train him/her as quickly as possible so that my dog learns good behaviours from an early age. 
- As a dog owner, I want to have the option of online training, so that I can still work on my dogs behaviour during the current pandemic. 
- As a dog owner, I want to see that the site owner is accessible so that I can contact easily when needed. 

### Strategy

#### External user’s goal
- Find professional help in solving specific issues relating to their dog’s behaviour. The idea of owning a dog has become different from reality and they would want to improve their dogs behaviour which in turn will reduce stress levels. 
- The site must convey that the training methods used are positive reinforcement and the use of force in training is not acceptable.
- A desire to understand dog training methods that can be practised easily in the home, getting the entire family involved. 
- As the dog is an important member of the family, trust is key and must be conveyed throughout the site.

#### Site owner's goal
- Create a website that provides a specific need for Dog Owners (user) what will generate income via the sale of various dog training solutions.
- Promote the importance of professional training and how this can  not only impact the dog’s life in a positive way, but also that of the entire family. 
- Demonstrate that training is not as difficult as some may and individual training plans, combined with consistency and fun, real positive results are achievable. 
- Demonstrate that the use of force in dog training no longer is acceptable nor desirable and that positive reinforcement techniques are key to how dogs learn. 

### Scope

#### Scope In 
- A web page that provides the end user (Dog Owners) with in person or online training programs that will help solve a specific or multiple dog behaviour problems - programs will target a specific set and common dog behaviour issues. 
- Demonstration of the site owners training methods.
- Provide the user with a visual experience of the site owners training history.
- Ability to contact the site owner for further information on any of the services offered within the site. 


#### Scope Out
- Group Class information, scheduling or ability to book directly on site will not be in scope for the first release.
- Advanced training programs will not be in scope for first release (example, advanced aggressive behaviour, scent work, any potential behavioural issues that could be resulting from a medical condition)

### Structure
The structure of information on the site will follow a simple approach with 4 pages: 
#### Home Page
- Key call to action for a new product on the landing page above the fold. 
Featured products with CTA’s that take the customer to the main Services page.
#### Services Page
- Provides details of the various training programs available to the end user. 
Each product will have a CTA that navigates the customer to the contact us page. 
#### Image Gallery
- A simple gallery of images demonstrating past dog training sessions with customers and their dogs. 
Contact us page. 
Contact methods include a form, a phone number, an email address, and social media. 

#### Footer 
- Fixed and will contain contact information, social media presence, and links to the services page. 

### Skeleton
- The site will be designed to allow the user to flow effortlessly from the home page to the contact us page with just the right amount of information to spark curiosity in the customer. The conversion goal for phase one of the site release is for the customer to contact the site owner.
- Each page will have a navigation bar to allow the user to self navigate. 
- Home page will have 3 or 4 featured products max, with each product having a clickable CTA that will navigate to the main services page where more detailed information is provided. 
- The main services page will provide more detail on each service offered, with each having a clickable CTA that navigates the customer to the Contact us page. 
- The Contact us page will provide a simple contact form with a text box for the user to provide a description of their needs. Additional contact methods will be displayed underneath the form (phone number, email address, social)
- The site navigation is designed to take the customer to the contact form page in 3 clicks max. 

### Mobile Wireframes
![Mobile Wireframes](assets/readme_images/mobile-wireframes.png)

[Wireframes for both mobile and desktop can be found here](https://github.com/scotty-james/Milestone-Project-1/blob/master/assets/docs/website-wireframes.pdf)

## Surface

### Design
My main goal for the site design is simplistic and clean throughout. I wanted to provide a crisp design that did not have strong contrasting colors so that it was simple on the users eye as they navigated through each section.
A stronger focus on dog related images is designed to create a strong emotional response from the sites target audience. 

### Colour
The main color scheme used throughout the site are 
- #212529
- #fca311

![Colour Palette](assets/readme_images/colour-palette.png)

### Typography
I have used 2 fonts throughout the site which were paired in [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans+Condensed#pairings) - Open Sans Condensed and Open Sans. Open Sans condensed is used for Title Headings throughout the iste and is set to uppercase whereas Open Sans is used for sub heading text. I had originally imported ‘Quicksand’ for the sub heading text however, once I added content to the site I felt the text didn't contrast well within the site, therefore changed to Open Sans for a better UX. 

## Features
 
### Existing Features
- Navigation bar with links to each page to allow the user to move back and forth freely, and freely browse pages that interest them most.
- Hero image with a strong CTA for the site owners Online Training program which is a need for both user and site owner during covid19.
- Clear visual demonstration on the homepage of the types of services on offer to the user so that the user is in no doubt what the website intention is. 
- An about us section on the homepage to draw the customers attention to the training method / philosophy used. 
- An image gallery to provide the user with a visual demonstration of the site owners dog training history to help build consumer trust. 
- Services displayed on a main services page provide the user with the information they need all in one section. 
- A simplistic contact us form, with phone, email and social contact options all in one page to enable flexibility and simplicity for the user to contact the site owner. 
- A fixed footer with contact information, social links, and additional navigation links to services offered to add more ease in for the user experience.  
- The website is responsive on all sites and built with a mobile first approach.

### Features Left to Implement
- A booking form to allow customers to book training directly on site. 
- A more detailed services page to provide the user with more information on how each training program can support their specific problem. 
- A page dedicated to class training programs that run for x number of weeks with a class schedule / timetable for future classes that can be booked in advance. 
- Specific pages that provide valuable non purchasable content for the user to interact with and take away - for example, how dogs learn, fun facts, diet tips, blogs etc.
